# Elementary-Sorting-Algorithms-Demo
Showcase for three basic sorting algorithms - Bubble, Selection and Insertion sort. 
These perform well on nearly sorted data and have better space complexity than more advanced sorting algorithms.

| 	Algorithm	  |	Time complexity (best) |Time complexity (worst) |Space Complexity|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------  | 
| Bubble Sort   | 		O(n)	    |	O(n^2)		    |		O(1)	       |	
| Insertion Sort| 		O(n)	    |	O(n^2)		    |		O(1)	       |	
| Selection Sort| 		O(n^2)	  |	O(n^2)		    |		O(1)	       |
